A webpage (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery) for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost:

 - Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
 - Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
